## The Porch Report 2021.v01 - An Ode to Days Past

We do not mourn when, in the fall and winter, the trees shed their browning leaves in exchange for the revelation of their bare, fragile branches. Why is that? For some of us it is because it is the natural order of things- the circle of life is to live and to die, and so on and so forth. We got to have our moment with the green leaves, a drop in the ocean of the universe of time and space, but for us, a significant moment nonetheless. For others, it is the comforting assurance that come spring time, new leaves will be born, again filling the skyline with a glimmer of green hope for future excitement. And for a small portion of us, the leaves falling means the holidays, the holidays means people returning to La Crescenta to break bread with loved ones and celebrate another year, and people returning to La Crescenta means hosting parties and hooking up with girls you went to high school with. Like literally most of them, even the Embeg's. We all have our reasons for not mourning the leaves and their descent from the sky to our feet.

This winter, our league, our little community of love for which hope seemed to always spring eternal, dropped more than just leaves. It lost a root. But, as with all trees, spring inevitably sprung, and new leaves grew once more. Before turning our attention to those, I'd like to mention the leaves that the League has shed in years past, and how it is we grew to be the tree it is today.

### **2010: A Seed is Planted**

In the beginning, the soil was barren. A seed was planted, but to grow, it needed to be resourceful. It required extreme circumstances, like using Yahoo Fantasy, and drawing on some nutrients that were not as efficient. Among others, these resources were George Vine, Daniel Eng, and Azzam Aloomalami.

Those times were tough, **but from the concrete, a sprout rose.** It lasted but one season before it shed some weight, and so we said goodbye to George and Dan. We thank them both for their soil. So it goes.

### **2011-2014: Digging the Roots**

Growth requires change. It's a cliché for a reason. In order to dig some roots and erect itself, our little shrub needed to make some changes. And so we moved to ESPN, and gained a few, including Jan Sakonju, Mark Sassounian, Steve Lee, and Nick Beatty. These folks cycled in and out through the consummation of our high school stint, and with them they inspired many memorable moments, including:

**Jan Sakonju:** Shnoot telling him to drug his kids to sleep so he could draft. 

**Mark Sass:** Drafting Tom Brady at the end of the first round and Michael Vick at the beginning 		of the second. It wasn't a 2QB league. We didn't let him take it back, and he didn't trade either the entire season.

**Steve Lee:** Wearing over the head headphones for the entire draft, listening to a weird Asian man whispering who to draft into his ear. Very strange.

**Nick Beatty:** His stint mostly consisted of A) dominating us and ripping us off with trades, and B) being bullied by Brines. Many will recall sharing class with Austin and Nick, and Austin turning around in class and going "Good fucking God Nick your nose is huge today. Jesus man." Though I can corroborate he had a massive nose, I'm not sure I can condone the behavior.


This period also included us becoming so obsessed with fantasy that we made a Facebook group to chat about it, and talked about it all snack and lunch, to the point where we were so nerdy and so virgin that Casey had to step in and lead us to a middle ground. We also moved into an auction draft during this time, and began hosting all of our drafts in Brines' living room. Typically, we would hold the draft the weekend before school started, complete with a feast, Mike Brines videoing us from a hand held camcorder that was originally used to make 80's porn in San Fernando valley, and all of us ripping ass after consuming Vons pot stickers and Azzam's cardiac arrest dip. It finished with us limping to our cars, standing in a circle realizing that the best day of the year had passed, swinging our keys and making small talk until someone made the call for us to buckle it in and officially end Summer. During those times, ready to brave whatever Altura and Encinal had in store for us in the coming days and months, that drive home felt like the end of the world. If only our naïve eyes could have seen the misery that was to come years later- we'd have been cheering the whole ride home, basking in our youth. Perhaps we can learn that later too, we will feel the same about this time of our lives. Youth is a gift. 

Our shrub had grown into a young man-tree, complete with the acne scars, embarrassing moments, and growing pains to boot. But when we crossed the graduation stage in the early Summer of 2014, we didn't realize that the awkward growth that occurred above ground was matched with the stretching of roots below it, roots that last to this day.

And so we said goodbye to Jan, Sass, Steve, and Nick the Nose. We thank them for their soil. So it goes.

### **2014-2019: Branching Out and Barking Up**

When you leave the structure of your hometown and high school, and eventually college, strange things happen. Things that seemed permanent aren't so. Conversations that were once so consistent are suddenly fragmented afterthoughts, pieced together by the occasional phone call and reminiscing over a holiday break. But for the lucky ones, we were fortunate to have a tree to sit under that provided shade when it got hot and cover when it rained. Our league, I believe, was an integral touch point for us through and after college. 


During this phase, our growth was not up, but out. The focus wasn't as much on how to grow more, but how to grow better. Eventually, Azzam faded into the distance, a distance that includes him having a nose piercing and posting anarchist memes that are incoherent as they are incongruent. We added Lukas Guathier for a season as a stop gap, amid some other in and out turnover. This phase, though, will be remembered for the **acquisitions of two incredibly valuable members:** Jakey the Boy and B, the slimy scumbag sleezeball, Wang. Jake originally joined as a stop gap, then he was too good so we ghosted him for a year, a then he joined permanently. In 2015, Bwang joined me as a part owner, drafted Kevin White and immediately learned from me how to be mediocre, and then joined as a full time member. In 2016, we completed our formation into an adult tree, complete with 8 supple and able gentleman. We had grown out and established our new branches that gave us the unique character we have today. 

This period was also marked by dominance from Juho, led by Antonio Brown and Le'Veon Bell, then dominance by Cmag, built off the back of incredible roster management (and a bit of love from the college draft), and those two periods sandwiched a 2017 win for Bwang in his sophomore campaign. 2016 saw the Jamison Crowder fumble to lose the last place game and the accompanied Spongebob suds picture and 2018 saw the introduction of the locker room reports and the Vegas flu scandal. 2019 saw the upgrade to the 2QB league and efforts for future expansion with Brett co-owning with Jake.

This period was a stabilizing and reassuring one; a period of the validation and rediscovery of identity. But little did we know, there was trouble in the roots. And so we said goodbye to Azzam and Lukas. We thank them for both their soil. So it goes.

### **2020-Present: Bearing Fruit and Springing Anew**

Every tree hits a point where it needs to pause the growth of its branches and start letting those branches bear fruit. The 9 years of growth culminated in the bearing of fruit in 2020 with the long awaited expansion to 10 teams, bringing in **Brett and Gadsby to give us a bountiful free with a strong trunk and plenty of fruit.** It was paradise- we had a full league and full hearts to match. A league that seemed primed for a run into old age, clear of its past transgressions (the college draft), chalk full of talent and ambition. Despite a pandemic, we steamrolled ahead, managing to get half of the league in person to draft in the middle of the hottest weekend of the year in Palm Springs. It wasn't perfect- shitty even- but it was ours and it was us. This was our tree that we grew over the years. 

**And then came the darkest winter.** On one January morning, a tree that was so recently filled with the greenest leaves and the ripest fruit was just as soon bare to the bones, devoid of leaves with rotting roots. Silence ensued, and a winter that demanded that spring be deferred reigned supreme. For what felt like years, fantasy was an afterthought and the tree was a distant memory.  A period of reflection ensued- how could a root that was spawned from the very seed that birthed us so quickly rot? A careful examination revealed that it wasn't a quick rot, but rather a slow, gradual rot over the course of years. A rot too gradual to notice if you weren't looking for it, but that became easily apparent at the slightest wind or sudden bolt of lightning. 

And so we said, solemnly, suddenly, and unexpectedly, goodbye to our dear friend and two-time defending champ, Juho Matthew Kim. ***We thank him for his soil.*** So it goes.

What I didn't mention about trees at the beginning is that eventually, they all die. Every tree, no matter how long it stands, will have a final spring where it grows new leaves, and a final winter where it sheds its life, fading into the abyss from there on. Pretty fucking depressing. We can acknowledge the beauty of the green on those leaves and how amazing the tree once looked and enjoy those memories. We can also acknowledge the duality that it fucking blows when that tree dies. Both are simultaneously true.

Another thing about trees though- the fruit serves more purpose than just for taste. That fruit comes down with the leaves in the fall, but it does something more. It sheds seeds; new, hopeful, fresh seeds. Some of those seeds become never make it, but some of those seeds find a familiar home in the soil and begin a new tree entirely. This spring, one of those seeds, in the darkest winter, nudged into the soil. And that was a seed that carried with it the DNA of the former tree, but with a twist of skully's, college baseball coaching, and courtesy ass. **And so, Joey Bats entered the picture.** The seed we didn't knew we needed, all along. The scratchy voice echoing from the dugout at Walter State, calling us all home. The voice of Joseph Ripken Babe Ruth Aaron Hernandez Torres. 

A new summer is here, my brothers, the sprouting of a new tree. It is gorgeous, and growing every day. The roots are digging as we speak. Roots that take us from sea to shining sea, from Los Angeles and San Diego to New York and Orlando, and soon to be overseas in Germany, and everywhere in between. Roots that will surely extend elsewhere over time to God knows where, evolving all along the way, twisting in ways that we can't currently comprehend. Roots that received a massive amount of fertilizer in Miami on one fateful Labor Day weekend. A tree I am confident will continue to bear fruit, forever, even when none of us is any longer. Tell me that isn't fucking beautiful.
