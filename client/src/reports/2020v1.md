## The Porch Report Vol.1 9.23.2020 - Locker Room Rankings

Well well well. Hello again old friends. After a long a dark period, I'm happy to announce the return of the weekly locker room reports. I could go on and on, but you don't give a shit about that anymore than you do about Cmag hating double headers, so I won't. I'm really just here to provide a brief departure from our sad, exhausted existence. So it goes.

Since I last reported, some things have changed: We've added Brett and Gats, Jake became the mayor of New York City (but it was the version of New York City where no one was there), Brines added another 16 countries to his hookup list, Shnoot started dating a UFC fighter, and Cmag and Juho combined committed enough HR violations to make Enron look look like a a non-profit.

Some things haven't changed: Brett is still recruiting balding white kids in polos to join Phi Delt in middle America, Bradley still gets off to girls that weigh more than him, Bwang is still only our friend during football season, Gats is still posting pictures of him holding his girls hand as she walks into the sunset, and I still wear flannels, Monster energy hats, stance socks with weed leaves on them, and hangout at Blue Moon with Robby Benson, Jessyca Kim, Blake Ruff, and Gillian Powell. Aha.

Now, to the important stuff. A lot is going on in our locker rooms to report on. Here are the official Hooman Locker Room Power Rankings.

1. **XxLarry LegendxX**: Like his good buddy Trump in 2016, Larry has been the train no one saw coming, and that none of us wanted to see coming either. Larry and my Dad have a few things in common: They get off to the thought of acquiring the assets they see on Tik Tok, and they both have noses that are growing by the second. Now I haven't seen Gats in person to confirm because he's been out in Florida partying at Epstein's vacant mansion, but I've heard the wind whistling through his face flute and can tell you there is some volume. Gats has been slinging so much software that an Amish person would buy some, that's how hot he is. After Dak and Aaron Jones' performances this past weekend, Gats was pictured belligerently strolling on Honolulu, throwing up without breaking stride. Unfortunately for us, Larry isn't going anywhere, and neither is his locker room of Red MAGA hat wearing players. These guys are gelling.

2. **POWER BOTTOMS**: It's week two and Juho has already fucked every staff member in the org and visited their home towns (they all live in Houston). Juho was recently named the top athlete in Houston, which he took from J.J. Watt and James Harden, purely for his moves in the sack. The guy shags like a jackrabbit on cocaine. Unfortunately for us, his bravado has expanded to his locker room. This organization has sent as many dick/pube pics from the locker room this week as the rest of the league has combined its in entire existence. Opposing players also complain of the loud music- it has been reported that two albums are played full volume on loop: "The Wiggles Greatest Hits" and Chance the Rapper's "The Big Day". When asked, opposing players say they would actually prefer a roaring crowd. The locker room, while sickening from the outside and unconventional, has the swagger of Juho putting on a suit to walk from his bedroom to his dining room table for his one month internship this summer. And it's translating to the field. They're good now, but the big question here is sustainability: can this lifestyle last, or will he eventually commit enough HR violations for it to lead to his demise?

3. **3 AM Craps w/ Santa**: The most hated guy in the league is back, and we can see through him like the pristine lake of water that Shnoot is probably partying his ass off currently. He doesn't like us, and he doesn't want to be our friend. He wants to beat us, and he wants to take our money. He gets off to it. And if you think for a second this guys isn't going to pull some slimy, dirty, underhanded, COVID related shit, you're mistaken. He is a pig in the mud. I've heard rumors he orchestrated the hit on Marlon Mack, and the picture of him naked in the crowd with a condom wrapped around the head of his pecker certainly supports that. His drive to succeed and his competitive edge is so strong, he reportedly brought in Skip Bayless to scold Hayden Hurst after he comforted Dak so that he could retain the cutthroat mentality of the team. This locker room is all business, no fun, just a bunch of guys working hard and Bwang playing with his little guy in the corner, fantasizing about who he can screw next. It's sickening, but we knew this was coming.

4. **Foot Foam**: This is where it starts to get a little concerning. Addiction is a disease, and one that is incredibly overlooked, underrepresented, and stigmatized in our society. Brines is ill, and he needs help. He has a sick, sick, sick fetish/addiction for owning quarterbacks. Here is a list of the quarterbacks he has sex dolls with faces taped on: Cam Newton, Arod, Russ Wilson, Derek Carr, Jeff Driskel, Baker Mayfield, Tom Brady. Worth noting that the poor guy is so sick he's owned almost 25% of the leagues' QB's. It's week fucking two. And his greasy nose is so sick that, I heard from an inside source, after he acquired Derek Carr he actually tried to trade Derek Carr back to Hooman for Mitch Trubisky. Immediately. It's disgusting. And on top of this, it's been reported that his stretch of summer camp has come to an end, which means that he's going to revert to his nasty habits, even moreso than usual. It won't be long till he's got more QB's in his sex doll selection. Out of respect for his addiction, I won't even be commenting on his team's performance until we see some help and progress with his condition. In this hard world, we're cheering for you Brines.

5. **Secret Hitler**: The other new guy, he's made some waves, most notably making me his pledge bitch this week. His beatdown of me might as well have been a hazing ritual- he spanked and burned his initials on my ass. To be frank, the guy's team was expected to be a dud, and it still may be, but god damn so far these guys have bought into the brotherhood Brett is preaching. Unfortunately, it's looking like Carson Wentz, who was caught masturbating in the back of the bus on a date dash, will be dropped from the group. It's tough, but the right move. Only time will tell if these guys are going to be able move into being a top tier house, or fall in with the scrub bottom feeders. Only one thing is clear- the pledge class is a mixed bag, but they're fully bought in, and they will be walking me like a dog for weeks to come.

6. **Bloated and Moody**: The league's most problematic team is back, and as entertaining as ever. After week one, Bradley booked a trip to Vegas to celebrate his inevitable championship win. We wish we were kidding. What's worse, the guy lost it all at the buffalo machine and blackjack table, and then ordered a hefty escort to go back to his hotel room with him. She didn't have to be hefty, but those were Brad's demands. After getting off to a hot start, his squad came back down to earth faster than Juho's pants when his girl asks to see his bush. They were bloated, and they were moody. And unfortunately, with that, came back Brad's anger issues. We can only hope that he still has the anger management book I sent him last year. Poor Kirk Cousins is going to need it. A team insider told me that after the game, Brad staged a fake crucifixion in the locker room with him playing the role of Pontius Pilot and Kirk playing Jesus to mock Kirk's religious beliefs. It was really sad, and apparently really emotional for a lot of players. So much so that David Johnson actually requested a trade. The bottom line: the team looks good on paper, but with the big, brittle, duck butter wearing, big girl loving emotional mess leading the charge, that paper may either be used as a jizz rag or burned up. One thing is for sure: we'll all enjoy the ride.

7. **Florida Pig with Lipstick**: If Shnoot struggles this season, you won't hear any criticism from us: the guy is splitting time running a team and training his girl for her UFC co-headliner this fall. The girl looks like she could beat the shit out of me. I'd enjoy her spitting in my mouth though. And it's a shame too- McGavin has the most talented roster he's had. But if there is anyone who can be a sports psychologist, an MMA trainer, a PHD student, and a GM, it's Schmit. And he'll do it all while partying his ass off on a packed beach in Florida, wearing a fannypack and a backward vizor. He is patient zero for COVID. The talent for this squad is there, but can he work his vodoo and stretching magic to lead them to victory, or will he neglect his culture to focus on his other endeavors?

8. **Batch CTO**: How the mighty have fallen. Not long ago, Jake was the center of the social media universe, riding a wave of popularity and swooning hoards of women at once en route to a stunning Betchlorette victory. Now, he is working on designing an app that helps a bunch of dudes in their mid 20's get off: The Batch fantasy league app. It was a fast rise and a faster fall, and his locker room has paid the price. The CTO apparently put some code together that switched his calendar to 2017, because he's starting Jamaal Williams. This is a locker room that made the most headlines in the offseason, but just can't get the same results on the field. Some long tenured team members have said that, as difficult as it was, they miss the days of being force fed MDMA and listening to Skrillex to enhance their performance. "He just hasn't been the same since he posted the shirtless Instagram picture", says the anonymous source. This is a team at a crossroads, looking for an identity, and unfortunately for them, there isn't a virtual dating show to help them find it.

9. **Binkies and Wigs**: The only reason Hooman's squad isn't last is that the last team is in such a bad spot it might not be publishable. With that being said, holy fuck it's bad in the locker room. OBJ punched Homer in the mouth after last week's debacle, leading to the trade this week. His runningbacks were picked up from the Gladiators, and he will now depend on Tarik Cohen, James White, Mark Ingram, Mike Davis, and Devonta Freeman to round out his RB's and flexes. It's like watching Xander Trimis doing his flag dance: it's funny, but underneath is a wave of pity. The rumor mill has churned out some filthy rumors over time, but this one might be the grossest: Homer is rumored to be brining in Brock Hendricks to be his Chief People Officer. Sources are bewildered as to why he's doing it, but for some reason Hooman seems to believe that writing Happy Birthday on Rosemont girls' Facebook walls will solve his teams issues. In reality, the short hairy little guy is relying on Tom Brady's noodle arm and hard nosed culture to fix his team. The outlook is ugly.

10. **Walter State Backup QB's**: Last, and 100% least, is the 2X returning champ. Let's just quickly recap what Cmag has been up to since his most recent Championship win:

    - Had to cancel a long planned trip to Japan
    - He died his hair blonde
    - He moved out of the town he is the mayor of
    - He traded a shag for a set of dumbells
    - He met a girl Brines hooked up with on Hinge, went on a date with her, ghosted her and swore he would never shag her, and then got drunker than a big and shagged her
    - Drafted Joe Mixon and Tua like they were Kirk Warner and Marshall Faulk

    It wouldn't be surprising then to see a tough offseason combined with a championship hangover create a slow start. But then, the unthinkable happened: his first born son, Saquon, suffered an ACL tear. Cmag had both of his ACL's surgically removed to be offered to Saquon, to which the team doctor replied "That's not how that works". So Cmag is now quite literally a Japanese man with no knees. Coincidentally, the same team doctor stabbed Tyrod Taylor's lung pregame. And, in a sickening but unsurprising turn, Brines was rumored to be attempting to trade for Tyrod's punctured lung. A slight bit of good news- whereas old Moneyball used to cope with these types of things by getting black out drunk, doing coke, and banging strippers and players wives in the locker room, he has now taken to a different, and equally concerning, coping mechanism. This mechanism consists of two things: berating the idea of double headers and coddling Joe Mixon. The second part, I identify with: I too have fallen in love with the idea of a man who runs 15 times for 70 yards, doesn't score, and doesn't play in two minute drills. Cmag was apparently asking for a year of real dollar salary, two RB1's, and next years entire draft budget for Mixon in a trade and was quoted as saying "I'm doing you a favor on this one". If history is any indicator, he will right the ship, and to be honest, that might be a win for all of us if it calms his pecker down.

I'm excited for the season. Cheers!
