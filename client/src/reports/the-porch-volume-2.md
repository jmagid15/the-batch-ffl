## The Porch Report Vol.2 10.7.2020 - Locker Room Rankings

_"God, grant me the serenity to accept what I cannot change, the courage to change what I can, and the wisdom to know the difference."_

-The Serenity Prayer

I don't know much, but in the two weeks since Volume 1 of The Porch Report, I can tell you a few things I've noticed. For one, there is a not a lot of accepting things we can't change in this league. There is also not a lot of courage, or wisdom for that matter. Or really integrity, or maybe any other redeeming qualities. A cursory scan of our communication does reveal a few qualities in the members of our league: extreme hubris (Juho), pure anger and hatred (Brad), insufferable complaining (Brines, Casey), and perhaps, above all, a concerning level of commitment and obsession (Bwang).

So what does this all mean? I honestly can't say, but I doubt it's positive. What I do know is, as always, there is a ton to report on from the various locker rooms around the league, so let's get right to it.

**Week 4 Locker Room Rankings**

1. **XxLarry LegendxX:** Still sitting atop the rankings is Larry himself. Never have I seen a person have a fantasy football honeymoon phase, but 2020 truly is full of surprises. Coming off of a league high 217 point week, Gats was seen dancing around like a little man in the locker room. According to inside sources, in the center of the locker room is a shrine of Bwang. Periodically, Aaron Jones and Gats will gather around the shrine, do a fake prayer, and then start laughing hysterically.

   Gadsby was apparently so elated that he decided to purchase a trip for his lady to the Caribbean for the week- he won't be joining due to his duties in the locker room, but that's just how jolly the guy is now. Even more sickening is his social media documentation of the event, seen below.

   Buckle up gents, we're in for a bumpy ride with this one.

2. **Secret Hitler:** What a start for the new guys. The brotherhood remains strong, leaping up from 5th place in the power ranking 2 weeks ago. On paper, this group of guys looks more like a Phi Delt colony pledge class than an NFL team. So how are they getting it done on the field?

   The key: their social calendar. Brett has more events lined up for his guys than the league has ever seen. In lieu of Friday walk throughs, sources say they have been having date dashes. They are also sprinkling in other social events weekly, whether it is a scavenger hunt with the cheerleaders, making PB&J's for the local homeless community, or holding brotherhood events to build chemistry. This team is on the same page, and the bad news for us: it's just getting started. With formal season fast approaching, word on the street is that Brett has stacked the calendar with a formal every single weekend. This includes functions with other teams' cheerleaders, local women's groups, and, the most sickening, a group of older women from a senior home. But, regardless of criticism, Brett stays the course. "Let the boys play", he says. Spoken like a true leader.

3. **Binkies and Wigs:** Rifling up from 9th place last week, after trading away OBJ, all this squad has done is rattle off a pair of Top 5 finishes and a 3-1 record, putting itself back into contention. Homer can't draft, but he's never had a locker room that he can't coach to victory. However, not everything is roses in Homan Land- it was announced today that Julio Jones has launched a lawsuit against the team for some questionable practices in their medical treatment of his injured hamstring.

   Inside sources said that, during halftime of the Falcons and Packers game on Sunday night, with a matchup against Cmag at stake, Homer became unraveled when Julio reinjured his hamstring. I was told that the little man pushed his way into the room where Julio was getting treatment, said "If this doesn't get the job done, I don't know what will", and proceeded to pull down his pants and position himself over Julio's hamstring. \*\***NSFW Warning**\*\* Hammer then began violently stroking himself, claiming that his semen was a muscle relaxer. Poor Julio, face down, didn't see what was occurring over him. What's even sadder is that, during the session, Austin seemed to become increasingly tired while muttering under his breath "Fuck, it's just not happening today". By this time, Julio caught on, stormed out of the room and left the stadium. A really unfortunate event- not only did Hammer damage a relationship with one of his best players, butthe old chap also couldn't even get through a jerk off session without tuckering out, in front of his team's entire medical staff. Needless to say, this will be a story to follow in the coming weeks.

4. **Florida Pig with Lipstick:** The unlikely run of successful teams continues with the King of COVID himself. The little piggy is up to all of his old tricks: mandatory hot yoga with the team, training his girlfriend in MMA, all while partying his ass of somewhere in Florida. So what's different this year? The answer, according to those close to the situation: the mental edge.

   This year, Shnoot has taken the hands on approach to managing the psyche of his players. He individually tutors, consults, and counsels each player. How the guy has enough time in the day for all this, we may never know. What we do know is, it's working. Another piece of interesting information: in addition to scheduling individual one on one time with each player, Schmut also has bi-weekly meetings with each player's wife. Why, may you ask? We went to the source. I asked tight end George Kittle what the nature of these meetings is, and his response was direct: "Yeah, he's shagging them." I was stunned. According to Kittle, Shnoot claims that an important aspect of maintaining a balanced locker room atmosphere is that the women feel sexually pleasured when around the team as well, to match the male energy in the locker room. "Why don't the players just shag their wives themselves, then?" I asked. Kittle's response: "What are we going to do, each individually plow our wives? That would distract us from our day to day routines. It's a lot easier to have Shnoot plow all of our wives periodically so we can focus on preparing for game day. In our book, it's a win-win. We get to focus on our jobs and our wives get to have a nice shag. They really enjoy it".

   And as for the fuck machine himself? "I'm a masters and will likely be a PhD. This stuff works". Right on, Shnoot.

5. **3 AM Craps w/ Santa:** A model of consistency, the team is right back in the thick of it. Despite some injuries over the weekend, the team continues to churn out victories, all thanks to Bwang's incredibly problematic obsession with Fantasy Football.

   Anonymous sources that participate with Bwang in separate leagues have confirmed that he spent the weekend drafting a 400 page piece of legislation for his leagues in anticipation of any future issues with Coronavirus. It was generally agreed upon that a simple email was sufficient, but Bwang opted to grab some lotion, tissues, a binkie, and a choker, sit down at the computer, and get to work. This guy is on one track and one track only- the Matthew Berry track. It will only be so long until the guy is giving away shitty fantasy advice and even shittier stories to go with it, advice that guys like Cmag will take and then make fun of us for not taking. And so the cycle continues, and, as per usual, the cycle includes Bwang's locker room clicking and him being in the playoffs. Watch out though- sources have informed me that their have been some potential labor violations being investigated here.

6. **Walter State Backup QB's:** The team anchoring last place in the last edition of the rankings, initially it looked like again it was headed the wrong way. What started with a Tua fist pump, and morphed into a Saquon ACL tear continued to take a weird turn, with Cmag buying the bag of skin that is Dion Lewis for \$23 dollars, making fun of the league for not bidding on him, then deflecting the blame to Matthew Berry when Dion put up a goose. What resulted was a weird passive aggressive exchange with Brines that somehow resulted in Brines being Venmo'd five dollars.

   At this point, it would have been easy to open the casket and put the Walter State Backups to rest. However, it's well documented that nothing gets Cmag's locker room going like a matchup with Homer, and god damn it fired them up. A rivalry that dates back to running day at Rosemont, the history is thick, and Casey's pecker even thicker at seeing the matchup this week. What resulted? As per usual, a high scoring affair with plenty of chirping, with Cmag coming out on top. Rumor has it to fire his squad up, Cmag placed blonde hair die in each of his player's lockers and proceeded to ask them "Who is man enough to sack up and die their hair too". It was an apparently weird affair as shortly after Cmag broke down and began talking about attachment theory to a 19 year old female clubhouse attendant. But, just in time to save the day, two old friends of Cmag entered to deliver the keynote speech to send his squad into victory: 2001 Justin Timberlake and Abby Wambach. The rest is history.

7. **Bloated and Moody:** The league's most entertaining locker room was back to its old tricks in recent weeks. After a tough couple of matchups that saw Brad's squad go 0-4 in the last few weeks, many expected the usual from the Big Guy- a massive anger outburst, verbal and physical abuse to his players, and a late night Uber to Sherman Oaks. What ensued was something worse than any of us could have imagined.

   The team, expecting the usual wrath on Monday morning, arrived to the practice facility to shocking changes: The entire training, fitness, and conditioning staff fired, the slogan "It all starts with fitness" plastered everywhere in sight, and audio of Gary Vaynerchuk and Tai Lopez playing on loop. There was also some guy named Jake who was appointed "Chief Hustle Officer". At the front of the room was Bradley, wearing aviators and gym attire. The first order of business? Every player must put entrepreneur in their Instagram and Twitter bios. "We are a fucking start up now. And we're going to run our team like one."

   Brad and Jake took over conditioning and fitness responsibilities for the team, organizing workouts and Holmby Park, against the advice of their counsel. Each player was required to submit a "Side Hustle" idea to Jake, who then met individually with each player. According to inside sources, these meetings had nothing to do with the ideas that the players put forth. Said one anonymous player "The whole meeting consisted of Jake talking about SEO optimization, drip marketing, and some idea he had for a shot glass that is also a butt plug." The player continued "I majored in business in college. I had a pretty good idea about a software solution for non-profits to fundraise. Jake just kept saying 'Yeah that's great but check out this flyer though. Sick right?". The Porch Report obtained a copy of said flyer.

   Sick indeed.

8. **POWER BOTTOMS:** Things change fast in this league. In two weeks, the Power Bottoms became the Bottom Feeders. Coming off a first few weeks of incredible sex, the unthinkable happened: The Greyhound began to experience erectile dysfunction. Is it physical? Is it psychological due to performance anxiety? Hard to know, but the once notorious sex addict is floundering, and the locker room is following suit.

   A locker room that once had the swag walk of NWA walking down Rosecrans in the heart of Compton is now looking at a starting lineup that includes Brett Rypien, Keelan Cole, and 3 tight ends. The sad thing? He won the fucking match up. More on that later, but shameful nonetheless. If we know Juho, we know that he'll find away to get the Greyhound's engines running again and the normal bus route from Nashville to Houston running again, and likely sooner rather than later. With the Steelers returning to action, his libido should return in short order. If not, it's going to be a long season.

9. **Batch CTO:** This is one of those ones where it's tough to say a lot. For one, because Jake has created a beautiful app for us and put in a lot of effort to make it fun. But more importantly, his team is so bad that piling onto it doesn't even bring satisfaction. Coming off of a loss to the bottom feeders by a total of 3 yards, it's hard to imagine things getting much worse. Coming off of two weeks in a row as the lowest scorer, this team may actually be better served if, instead of coding the time back to 2017, Jake coded it back to 2011 so that his team could be the Cal marching band.

   The nice part about being at the bottom is that it's only up from here. Jake can implement as much software into his team as he wants, but the fact is that he needs Michael Thomas back, and he needs to improve a runningback room that would be better served with a platoon of Jeff Dale and Jamarcus Hammer. And one would think that, given his team's dire circumstances, he would be stepping up as a leader, but this seems not to be the case as Jake doubles down on internet fame. He seems to be losing the locker room too, and as his star player MT was quoted saying "He ain't talk to us."

10. **Pablo's QB Fetish:** If not for doubleheaders, Brines would be 0-4 as the highest scorer in the league. If not for his quarterback addiction, Brines would probably be the president of the United States. We can play what ifs all day long, but the truth remains the same: Brines is 4-4 and literally addicted to quarterbacks. He has spent time at multiple rehab facilities to no avail, and his poor family is paying the consequences. In a press release, the Brines family said "We appreciate the outpouring of support during this difficult time. We will continue to answer these challenges with love, and will work tirelessly until the Austin we know and love is back. Addiction is a disease, and one that we must confront head on."

    Every time there is a glimmer of hope, it seems like he relapses. This time, he picked up Kyle Allen, kissed his neck, and then spent \$11 on Jimmy G. "I can stop anytime" he says. Riiiiiiight. The only solace here is that, in a locker room of fetishes, complaints, addiction, and favoritism, the lack of leadership has forced players to step up. OBJ has emerged as an unlikely leader, providing an unlikely spark to a team in dire need of some optimism. As always Brines- this is bigger than sports, and we're here for you.

**Bonus Content:** Jokes aside, Brad literally posted a video of Jamaal Murray getting blown into our group text. Let's please not forget that anytime soon.
